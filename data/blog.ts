        <p>This creates cleaner separation of concerns and enables more flexible integration options as your needs evolve.</p>
        
        <h2>Security at Every Layer</h2>
        
        <p>Security vulnerabilities can emerge at any point in the stack. Best practices now emphasize security considerations throughout development - from API endpoints to frontend code.</p>
        
        <p>Regular dependency updates, input validation, proper authentication flows, and protection against common attack vectors should be standard practice.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>Modern website development balances many competing concerns - performance, accessibility, security, and feature richness. By following these best practices, developers can create websites that deliver excellent experiences while remaining maintainable and secure.</p>
